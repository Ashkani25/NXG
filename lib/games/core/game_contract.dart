/// ===================== NEXORA GAME CONTRACT (STEP_16) =====================
/// Every Arcade game is an independent module under lib/games/<id>/.
///  * Pure-Dart rules engine in lib/games/<id>/core/ (no Flutter/Flame imports,
///    deterministic, unit-tested; the same logic will run server-side online).
///  * Rendering (Flame or Flutter CustomPainter) + UI in lib/games/<id>/ui/.
///  * One entry function `Widget build<Name>Game(GameLaunch launch)` in
///    lib/games/<id>/<id>_entry.dart registered in game_registry.dart.
///  * When a match ends the game calls `launch.onFinish(GameResult(...))` exactly
///    once. The host shows the result screen, awards XP/coins and offers rematch.
///  * The host draws the exit button (top-start corner, 56x56 safe area): keep
///    that corner free of important UI.
